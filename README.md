Reptile: A scalable meta-learning algorithm

this is remake, not original

3000 iterations with loss = 0.058 (x2 better), the original is 6000 iterations with loss = 0.074, actually I did this for high speed for adaptation, but the accuracy is only slightly lower than the original (will happen when the iteration of original is very high (many times) i guess it's around 8-15 or something) :) (I only edited hyperparameters)


I do this for fun, and to learn a little more knowledge.
