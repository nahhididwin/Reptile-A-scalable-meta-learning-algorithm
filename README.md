Reptile: A scalable meta-learning algorithm

this is remake, not original

my project 3000 iterations with loss = 0.064 (2x better), the original is 6000 iterations with loss = 0.074, actually I did this for high speed for adaptation, but the accuracy is only slightly lower than the original :)

I do this for fun, and to learn a little more knowledge.
